Open Access Pub is a website designed to host scholarly articles, without the hefty subscription fees of traditional academic journals.  It deals with papers of all disciplines, automatically tags them with different topics, and can recommend papers to you based on your favorite tags and authors.   
Our vision is freedom of information, and this proof-of-concept shows that it can be done at minimal cost.
