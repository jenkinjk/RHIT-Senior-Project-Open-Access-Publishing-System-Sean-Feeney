instructions on starting server:
mostly for myself so i don't forget


*****
cd to the flask_code folder and run 
sudo python server.py

the sudo is necessary only because of our tempfile way of passing files from S3 to the user
that is also why you need to be in the flask_code folder when you run it


*****
on my arch linux box i have to run the redis server locally as well, and start it seperately with
sudo redis-server

from inside the virtual-environment if you use one
the sudo is apparently required for the database to be able to write to disk and save itself


*****
note that you can check up on redis by running redis-cli
tell it to shutdown, etc
